# Module 3: Mastery of Self 🧘

There is no separation between us and "the rest".
The foundation of global change is your ability to govern yourself.

## 1. The Power of Attention

Your attention is your true self.

### Practical Exercise: "The 60-Second Reset"
* **What:** Once every 3 hours, stop everything.
* **How:** Close your eyes. Focus only on the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils. Do not try to change it, just observe it.
* **Why:** This retrains your brain to focus on the "now" rather than the "next."

## 2. Global Impact
When we regain control of our attention:
1.  **Being over doing:** We reach the shift from human *doing* to human *being* — being becomes the starting point, and doing naturally follows from it.
2.  **Clarity rises:** We start acting based on real factors, not perceived impulses.
3.  **Presence:** We ARE fully present to what is happening (here and now).  
It is not happening somewhere.  
It is not happening **to us**.  
It is happening with and within us.
