# Module 1: Mastery of Self 🧘

The foundation of global change is the individual's ability to govern themselves. The primary task of every human being is to know themselves.

## 1. The Power of Attention

Your attention is your true self.

### Practical Exercise: "The 60-Second Reset"
* **What:** Once every 3 hours, stop everything.
* **How:** Close your eyes. Focus only on the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils. Do not try to change it, just observe it.
* **Why:** This retrains your brain to focus on the "now" rather than the "next."

## 2. Global Impact
When thousands of people regain control of their attention:
1.  **Clarity rises:** We start making choices based on real factors, not perceived impulses.
2.  **Presence:** We become capable of truly listening to the person in front of us.
